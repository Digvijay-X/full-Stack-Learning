# Flexbox Practice Project

This is my practice project where I learned and implemented different **CSS Flexbox properties**.  
I created this small project to understand how Flexbox works and how it can be used to align and arrange elements in a webpage.

## 📚 Topics I Practiced
1. What is Flexbox?
2. Display Flex
3. Flex Direction
4. Justify Content
5. Flex Wrap
6. Align Items
7. Align Content
8. Align Self
9. Flex Sizing
10. Flex Shorthand

## 💻 Project Structure
- `index.html` → Contains the structure and examples of all Flexbox properties.  
- `style.css` → Contains the styling and Flexbox implementation.  

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone or download the project.  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Check each section to see how different Flexbox properties work.

## 🎯 What I Learned
- Flexbox makes it very easy to align items horizontally and vertically.  
- Properties like **justify-content** and **align-items** help in positioning elements.  
- **flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis** are powerful for sizing elements.  
- Using **flex shorthand** is a shortcut instead of writing all three properties separately.

## ✨ Future Plans
I will use these Flexbox concepts in my upcoming small projects and layouts.  
Next, I want to practice **CSS Grid** along with Flexbox for better layouts.

## 📸 Output Preview
Each section in the project demonstrates one Flexbox property.  
For example:  
- `Display Flex` → makes elements sit in a row.  
- `Flex Direction` → changes row to column.  
- `Justify Content` → moves items left, right, center, etc.
